#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Shared interpreter resolution. Sourced (not executed) by the scrape drivers.
#
# Sets SDV_PY to a python that carries sportsdataverse + curl_cffi. Mirrors
# wehoop-wnba-raw/scripts/_venv.sh and hoopR-nba-stats-raw/scripts/_venv.sh so
# every SDV scrape entry point resolves its interpreter one way.
#
# Resolution order:
#   1. $SDV_VENV_PYTHON / $WNBA_VENV_PYTHON  -- explicit override, always wins
#   2. this repo's .venv                     -- the normal case
#   3. one-time `uv sync` bootstrap, then .venv again
#   4. ambient python3                       -- last resort, loudly warned
#
# WNBA_VENV_PYTHON is the legacy override name; ops/supervise_sweep.sh sets
# it from $SWEEP_PY. Both names are honoured, SDV_VENV_PYTHON first.
#
# (3) is deliberately NOT the banned "uv run inside a scrape". The ban exists
# because `uv run` re-syncs the venv to the lockfile ON EVERY INVOCATION, which
# can swap sportsdataverse under a running multi-hour sweep. This runs once,
# before any scraping, and only when the venv is missing -- so a fresh host
# becomes self-sufficient instead of needing a manual step.
#
# This file used to stop at (2) with a hard `exit 2`. When a venv sweep removed
# .venv on 2026-08-12, daily_refresh.sh died on that exit -- and because it
# sourced this file ABOVE its logging block, the failure wrote nothing at all:
# cron fired daily for two weeks and left an empty logs/ directory behind.
#
# (4) exists because a host without uv would otherwise be unrunnable. It is
# safe ONLY because every driver runs sdv_preflight immediately after sourcing
# this file. Do not use this resolver without that call.
